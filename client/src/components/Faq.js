      <h1>What is a ketogenic diet?</h1>
      <p>
        A ketogenic diet is a diet that is restricted in carbs and moderate in
        protein, resulting in an increased production of ketones.
      </p>

      <h1>What can I eat on a ketogenic diet?</h1>
      <p>There are plenty of delicious high-fat, low-carb options available.</p>

      <h1>Why is sugar bad for you?</h1>
      <p>
        When you consume sugar or carbohydrates (which get absorbed as blood
        sugar), this triggers an insulin response by your body.
      </p>

      <h1>How many carbs can I eat on a ketogenic diet?</h1>
      <p>Carbohydrate tolerance varies among individuals.</p>

      <h1>Should I count net carbs or total carbs?</h1>
      <p>
        It's recommend counting total carbohydrates, with the most of your food
        coming from real, whole foods.
